# Attendance-Managagement-System-Using-Facial-Recognition

Attendance management system is a necessary tool for taking attendance in any environment
where attendance is critical. However, most of the existing approach are time consuming,
intrusive and it require manual work from the users. This research is aimed at developing a less
intrusive, cost effective and more efficient automated student attendance management system
using face recognition that leverages on OpenCV functions for facial recognition. The system
provides a GUI for marking attendance. It provides an interface for updating attendance using
facial recognition libraries of OpenCV. The system stores attendance in a database which is
maintained by the administrator. The administrator can view, update and change the attendance
of the students. The students can view and update their attendance. The system is developed on
Open Source image processing library and the interface is developed using Python Tkinter
module. The Tkinter module is an open source module by which we can develop GUI screens
hence, it is not vendor hardware nor software dependent. The OpenCV module used for image
processing is interfaced using python.
